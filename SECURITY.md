## Reporting security problems to Jet Protocol

Please report the bug via [Immunifi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/jetprotocol/).

**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problem. Instead, please report the bug via [Immunifi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/jetprotocol/). If interested in integrating your proof of concept, provide your github username in the report so we can add you
to a new draft security advisory for further discussion.

For security reasons, DO NOT include attachments or provide detail sufficient for exploitation regarding the security issue in public. Instead, wait for the advisory to be created, and **provide any sensitive details in the private GitHub advisory**.

If you haven't done so already, please **enable two-factor auth** in your GitHub account.

Expect a response as fast as possible, typically within 72 hours.

If you do not receive a response within that time frame, please do followup with the team directly. You can do this through discord (#bug-reporting) by pinging the admins of the channel and referencing the fact that you submitted a security bounty.

As above, please DO NOT include attachments or provide detail regarding the security issue in public.
