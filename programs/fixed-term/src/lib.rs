//! An orderbook-based fixed term market hosted on the Solana blockchain
//!
//! # Interaction
//!
//! To interact with the fixed term market, users will initialize a PDA called an [`MarginUser`](struct@crate::orderbook::state::user::MarginUser).
//!
//! After `MarginUser` intialization, to place an order you must deposit underlying tokens or Jet fixed term market tickets into your account.
//! This will allow you to use the [`PlaceOrder`](struct@crate::orderbook::instructions::place_order::PlaceOrder) instruction, which
//! utilizes the orderbook to match borrowers and lenders.
//!
//! ### Lending
//!
//! To lend tokens, a user will deposit the underlying token into their `MarginUser` account. Then, they may post
//! orders on the book using the [`PlaceOrder`](struct@crate::orderbook::instructions::place_order::PlaceOrder) with a given set of
//! [`OrderParams`](struct@crate::orderbook::state::OrderParams).
//!
//! For example, to lend `1_000_000` tokens at 15% interest in a given market, a lender would specify:
//! ```ignore
//! OrderParams {
//!     /// We want as many tickets as the book will give us
//!     max_ticket_qty: u64::MAX,
//!     /// we are lending 1_000_000 tokens
//!     max_underlying_token_qty: 1_000_000,
//!     /// use the crate function to generate a limit price
//!     limit_price: limit_price_from_f32((1.0 / 1.15)),
//!     /// limit the number of matches to 100
//!     match_limit: 100,
//!     /// Do not fail transaction if order crosses the spread
//!     post_only: false,
//!     /// If order does not get filled immediately, post remainder to the book
//!     post_allowed: true,
//!     /// stake generated tickets automatically, creating `SplitTicket`s
//!     auto_stake: true,
//! }
//!```
//!
//! ### Borrowing
//!
//! For borrowing, a user has two options. They can buy Jet fixed term market tickets from some market, and deposit them into their
//! `MarginUser` account. Or, they may use the `jet-margin` program to place collateralized borrow orders.
//!
//! In the case of a collateralized order, an `TermLoan` will be minted to track the debt. A user must repay or face liquidation
//! by the `jet-margin` program.
//!
//! Example borrow order, where a borrower wants no more than 10% interest to borrow 100_000_000 tokens
//! ```ignore
//! OrderParams {
//!     /// We want to pay no more than 10%
//!     max_ticket_qty: 110_000_000,
//!     /// we only need to borrow 100_000_000 tokens
//!     max_underlying_token_qty: 100_000_000,
//!     /// use the crate function to generate a limit price
//!     limit_price: limit_price_from_f32((1.0 / 1.10)),
//!     /// limit the number of matches to 100
//!     match_limit: 100,
//!     /// Do not fail transaction if order crosses the spread
//!     post_only: false,
//!     /// If order does not get filled immediately, post remainder to the book
//!     post_allowed: true,
//!     /// borrowers do not stake tickets
//!     auto_stake: false,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Orderbook matching engine
//!
//! To facilitate the pairing of lenders and borrowers, the program utilizes the `agnostic-orderbook` crate to create an
//! orderbook. This orderbook allows lenders and borrowers to post orders using underlying tokens, held Jet fixed term market tickets, or, by utilizing `jet-margin` accounts,
//! a collateralized borrow order in lieu of held funds.
//!
//! ### EventQueue operation and Adapters
//!
//! The orderbook works by matching posted orders and pushing events to an `EventQueue` to be consumed by a crank operating offchain by
//! sending transactions to Solana.
//!
//! Some users may want to subscribe to events generated by the orderbook matching. To do this, a user must register with
//! the program an `Adapter` through their `MarginUser` account using the [`RegisterAdapter`](struct@crate::orderbook::instructions::event_adapter::RegisterAdapter) instruction. This instruction
//! creates an `AdapterEventQueue` PDA to which all processed orders containing the `MarginUser` account will be pushed.
//!
//! Users are responsible for handling the consumption logic for their adapter. To clear events after processing, use the [`PopAdapterEvents`](struct@crate::orderbook::instructions::event_adapter::PopAdapterEvents) instruction.
//!
//! # Jet Fixed Term Market Tickets
//!
//! Jet fixed term market tickets are fungible spl tokens that must be staked to claim their underlying value. In order to create tickets, a user must either
//! place a lend order on the orderbook, or exchange the token underlying the fixed term market (in practice, almost never
//! will users do this, as it locks their tokens for at least the tenor of the market).
//!
//! ### Ticket kinds and redemption
//!
//! The program allots for two types of ticket redemption. The [`ClaimTicket`](struct@crate::tickets::state::ClaimTicket) is given when
//! a user stakes directly with the program. As there is no information about the creation of the tickets, a `ClaimTicket` does not
//! have accounting for principal or interest, and only contains a redemptive value.
//!
//! Conversely, a [`SplitTicket`](struct@crate::tickets::state::SplitTicket) contains split principal and interest values. As well as
//! the slot it was minted. To create a `SplitTicket`, you must configure your [`OrderParams`](struct@crate::orderbook::state::OrderParams) `auto_stake` flag to
//! `true`. This will allow to program to immediately stake your tickets as the match event is processed.
//!
//! After the tenor has passed, the ticket may be redeemed for the underlying value with the program. Also included are instructions
//! for transferring ownership of a ticket.
//!
//! # Debt and Term Loans
//!
//! When using a `jet-margin` account to post a collateralized borrow order, an [`TermLoan`](struct@crate::orderbook::state::debt::TermLoan) is created to track
//! amounts owed to the program. `TermLoan`s are either repaid manually by the user, or handled by an off-chain liquidator.
